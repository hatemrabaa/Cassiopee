## The project

This project was done in team of three with AL KHALIL Nabil and FARES Imane. Here is my part of the work.

The aim of the study was to analyze the behaviour of students given their energy consumption. We wanted to be able to detect and interpret each level of consumption in order to optimize energy consumption and storage in the future.

We had at our disposal a first 9 months energy consumption data set of the Maisel's building U4 at Télécom SudParis Campus. Our dataset was made of several physical quantities recorded in 1-hour intervals.

We focused then on anomaly detection on time series in order to attribue abnormality scores. In this part, we implemented two methods of anomaly detection. The first one is based on spectral clustering using Dynamical Time Warping distance. The second one uses matrix reconstruction and residuals analysis to highlights abnormal consumption.

## Overview

This repository contains :

* A Jupyter notebook with implementations, results and interpretations of the U4 building's data.
